    "Typically we store a linked list as a single reference to the first node in the list, called the $code(head) node. Our $code(Node) constructor takes $code(data) as a parameter, which will act as the initial value of our new node. When a node is created, its $code(next) field always points to $code(null), meaning it has no value (this is often called a null reference/pointer).",
    "Putting this all together, we can create a new linked list with the line $code(Node head = new Node(0)). Note that this is creating a new $code(Node) object and setting its $code(data) field to 0. We also set its $code(next) field to $code(null) in the constructor, meaning that there is no next node in the list, therefore giving our list a length of 1."
