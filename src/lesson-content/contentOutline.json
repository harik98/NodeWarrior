        "Linked lists are a very commonly used data structure for representing ordered data. Each piece of data is held inside its own node object, with a reference to where the next node is located. This creates a chain-like structure where each node is only referenced by the previous node in the list."

        "In this module you will be exposed to the fundamentals of Linked Lists. You will start by learning about the fundamental unit of a Linked List (a node) and how these units can be chained together to create a list. From there you will learn how to manipulate these lists to your advantage in your code."
